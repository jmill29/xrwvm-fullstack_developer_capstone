# IBM Full-Stack Developer Professional Certification Capstone Project

## Overview

This project is the capstone for the IBM Full-Stack Developer Certification. It involves developing a comprehensive web application using Django and integrating multiple microservices. The main features include user management, car dealership and review management, sentiment analysis, and continuous integration and deployment.

## Project Architecture

The project is structured into several key components:

1. **Django Application**: Serves as the main web application framework.
2. **React Frontend**: Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.
3. **Node.js Microservices**: Manages dealerships and reviews, containerized with Docker.
4. **Sentiment Analyzer**: Analyzes review sentiments, deployed on IBM Cloud Code Engine.
5. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Ensures continuous integration and deployment of the application.

## Features

### Django Application

- **User Management**: Implemented using Djangoâ€™s user authentication system.
- **Static and Dynamic Pages**: Created using Django templates and React components.
- **Car Management**: Models and views to manage car make and model data.
- **Proxy Services**: Integrates Node.js microservices for dealers and reviews.

### Node.js Microservices

- **Express Server**: Manages dealers and reviews.
- **MongoDB**: Stores dealership and review data.
- **Dockerized**: Containerized for easy deployment.

### Sentiment Analyzer

- **IBM Cloud Code Engine**: Deployed for real-time sentiment analysis of reviews.
- **Sentiment Analysis Service**: Returns positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

### CI/CD Pipelines

- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and linting.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Deploys the application on Kubernetes.
